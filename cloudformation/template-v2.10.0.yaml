    Description: "Let RunsOn manage your networking stack (`embedded`), or use a stack under your control (`external`). If you select `external`, you will need to provide the VPC ID, the subnet IDs, and the security group ID, and make sure your whole networking setup is compatible with RunsOn (see https://runs-on.com/networking/embedded-vs-external/ for more details). To get started quickly, we recommend using the 'embedded' option."

    Default: ""

  ExternalVpcPublicSubnetIds:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Description: "List of PUBLIC subnet IDs of the external VPC to reuse, comma-separated. The more subnets you have, the more RunsOn will be able to find cheap spot instances, as well as balancing the load across many AZs. You must enter `-` if you don't have any public subnets."
    Default: ""

  ExternalVpcPrivateSubnetIds:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Description: "List of PRIVATE subnet IDs of the external VPC to reuse, comma-separated. The more subnets you have, the more RunsOn will be able to find cheap spot instances, as well as balancing the load across many AZs. You must enter `-` if you don't have any private subnets."

  VpcCidrSubnetBits:
    Type: Number

    Type: String
    Default: "false"
    AllowedValues:

      - "always"
      - "true"
      - "false"
    Description: "Enable ('true', 'always', 'only') or disable ('false') private networking. If 'true', your jobs can opt-in to launch in private subnets with the `private=true` label, and they will get a static egress IP. If 'always', all jobs will run in private subnets, and they will all get a static egress IP, unless you manually opt-out in your job definition with the `private=false` label. If 'only', then jobs can only launch in private subnets. Note that enabling it will create 1 managed NAT gateway, with the corresponding costs. More details at https://runs-on.com/networking/static-ips/."

    MinValue: 1
    MaxValue: 8
    Description: "Number of Elastic IPv4s to attach to _each_ NAT Gateway. Only applies if Private mode is enabled. Defaults to 1. Maximum of 8. Increasing this number is useful if you launch a large number of runners and are rate-limited by some external services due to the limited number of NAT Gateway IP addresses. Incurs ~$3.6/month additional cost for each Elastic IP. Note that by default you are limited to 2 EIPs per NAT gateway, but can request a quota increase from AWS."

  NatGatewayAvailability:
    Type: String
    Default: SingleAZ
    AllowedValues:
    - SingleAZ
    - MultiAZ

    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: "[DEPRECATED, prefer to use SSM for admin access]. Comma-separated list of GitHub usernames that will always be granted SSH access to all the runner instances (if SSH access is enabled), in addition to any repository admins. If blank, only repository collaborators with admin permission will be able to SSH into the runner instances."

  AppEc2QueueSize:
    Type: Number
    Default: 2
    MinValue: 1
    Description: "Number of queued jobs that can be processed concurrently by RunsOn. Each job takes about 2-3s to process. Increasing this value should be done with caution, as it will increase the number of EC2 instances that will be launched at once, eating into your AWS and GitHub rate limits. New AWS accounts come with a rate-limit of 2 RunInstances call/s, although you can request a higher limit from AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/throttling.html)."

    Default: "normal"
    AllowedValues:
      - "normal"
      - "conservative"
    Description: "Use normal or conservative GitHub API strategy. The conservative strategy will attempt to save GitHub API tokens by not automatically de-registering runners from the GitHub API after they are no longer needed. It's more elegant to clean them up (recommended), but in any case GitHub will eventually clean them up on their side after 24h. Especially useful if you launch tens of thousands of jobs every day."

    MinLength: 1
    Description: "When set to a repository name (e.g., '.github-private'), forces all repository configurations to extend from that repository.
