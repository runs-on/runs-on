# RunsOn: 10x cheaper GitHub Actions runners.

**Remove 90% of your CI spend**. **Faster** builds. **Fully self-hosted**, in your AWS account.

RunsOn is the **modern way to run self-hosted GitHub Actions runners** of any size, at the cheapest price available. Think of it as your best alternative to the Actions Runner Controller (ARC) for Kubernetes, the Philips terraform module, or any of the third party providers that require deep access to your code and secrets.

- ✅ **Faster**. Raw [CPU performance is up 30%](https://runs-on.com/benchmarks/github-actions-runners/) compared to official runners.
- ✅ **Cheaper**. Between [7x to 15x cheaper](https://runs-on.com/pricing/) than official runners.
- ✅ **Scalable**. Handles bursts of multiple hundred jobs at once without issue. No concurrency limit.
- ✅ **Full workflow compatibility** with official GitHub runners. Use the [compatible public AMIs for AWS](https://github.com/runs-on/runner-images-for-aws), or [bring your own images](https://runs-on.com/features/byoi/).
- ✅ **Low maintenance**. A single [CloudFormation template](./cloudformation/template.yaml) with all the resources, 1-click install, 1-click upgrades. Costs $1.5/month.

## Features

- [Linux](https://runs-on.com/runners/linux) (x64 and arm64), [Windows](https://runs-on.com/runners/windows), [GPU](https://runs-on.com/runners/gpu) support.
- **Ephemeral VM** for each job.
- [Spot pricing](https://runs-on.com/features/spot-instances/), with **automatic fallback** to on-demand.
- Multi-AZ, and multi-[environments](https://runs-on.com/configuration/environments/) support.
- **Fast and unlimited GitHub Actions cache**: An [integrated cache backend](https://runs-on.com/caching/s3-cache-for-github-actions/) based on a local S3 bucket allows for up to 5x faster and unlimited cache for dependencies and docker layers.
- **SSH access** into the runners. Can be [restricted to a specific CIDR range](https://runs-on.com/networking/ssh/).
- **Static IPs** for your runners, if you [enabled private networking](https://runs-on.com/networking/static-ips/).
- Automatic [**cost and alert reporting**](https://runs-on.com/features/cost-and-alert-report/).

## License

The code for the main repository (the current one, with the CloudFormation templates to deploy the AWS resources) is MIT licensed.

However the code in the `server/` submodule is proprietary and requires a license to use it:

- A non-profit (free) license is available if you are using RunsOn in a non-profit organization (this must apply to any parent organization as well), or if you are using it for personal use.
- For commercial organizations, you can evaluate for free for 15 days with a Demo license, after which you must buy a commercial license: 300€/year for the standard license, 1500€/year for the sponsorship license.

RunsOn has an insane ROI for commercial organizations. The monthly license cost is usually recouped within a few days. To learn more about licenses, visit the dedicated [pricing](https://runs-on.com/pricing/) page.

Access to the following code is public:

- CloudFormation template
- Public compatible AMIs for AWS

With a Sponsorship license, you get full access to the entire source code of RunsOn: server + agent (contained in the `server/` submodule), and can even modify it for internal use.
